# LBCC-RMP-EXTENSION

This extension scrapes the Long Beach City College class schedule and the relevant Rate My Professor pages to display rate my professor scores in the extension pop up window for convenience while picking classes.

**This project was created for the BeachHacks 2019 Hackathon. Project is incomplete and currently facing several errors, mostly revolving arround attempting to return a string from an async function**

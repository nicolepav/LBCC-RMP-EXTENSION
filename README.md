# LBCC-RMP-EXTENSION

This chrome extension scrapes the Long Beach City College class schedule and the relevant Rate My Professor pages to display rate my professor scores in the extension pop up window for convenience while picking classes. 

Originally created for the BeachHacks 2019 Hackathon. Project is incomplete pending several issues.
